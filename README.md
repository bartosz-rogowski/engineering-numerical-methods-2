# Laboratory programs and results for course "*Engineering Numerical Methods 2*". 

All programs and scripts are written by me.

---

In order to get results, one has to use commands: `make; make run; make graph`.

*makefile* help: `make help`

Tasks can be found [here](http://home.agh.edu.pl/~chwiej/imn_2.html).
